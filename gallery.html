For this assignment, we had to use a tool called “fine selection”, to select the dandelion, and dandelion puffs perfectly from one image, and then move the dandelion to another image. This was a big hassle, since selecting the dandelion was a tough job, but in the end, the product, to me, was amazing."

                    description="The “December 12th Timed Assignment”, as mentioned by the name, was a timed assignment, and my first timed assignment. This meant that I only had one period to finish this assignment. Though it was stressful, once I got into the flow, it was exciting and fun. For this assignment, I had to snip out a Christmas tree from one image, and in another image, put the tree behind other trees to make it fit in the image. I also had to snip a house from one image, make it way smaller, put it into a part of the new image, and create a reflection of it. For this timed assignment, I had to use most of the skills I’ve learned throughout this course. "

                    description="For this practice review, we had to use five skills to create different images. For this image, I used the shadow, and skew tools to try my best to create a realistic image. First, I selected a lamppost from another image, then moved to an image of grassy ground. Then, I used skew to fit it in the image, create a shadow of the lamppost, selected some grass and moved it up, to overlap the bottom of the lamppost to make it more realistic. "

Though the wave ripples do look overexaggerated a bit, I think that the end product turned out to be amazing."
